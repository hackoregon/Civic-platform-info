# Civic-platform-info
Information hub for the Civic platform

### Hack Oregon Fall/Winter 2016 Project Mission
#### Call to Action
Hack Oregon is partnered with early adopters from the City of Portland and Civic Apps to reimagine the concept of an interactive open data portal, called CIVIC, which can serve to inform and engage the public as well as provide insight to City operations and decision making.

#### Vision
This year, we’re designing and building a platform to publish all our projects as dynamic story collections powered by open APIs. Story collections will be highly custom based on each team’s perspective, but will all include a mix of data visualization, data science and analysis, and creative content.

#### Context
Many of the data sources we are working with this year have never been machine-readable or available online. Even if a data source is not used in a story, we have the intent to make data sources securely, searchable, and accessible through linked APIs. In all possible cases, we will make our best attempt to create for interdepartmental compatibility between data sources.
